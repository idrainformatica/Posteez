# Post++

This project is Post++, a tool to schedule social media and chat posts to 28+ channels.

You can add posts to the calendar, they will be added into a workflow and posted at the right time.

## Features

You can find things like:

- Schedule posts
- Calendar view
- Pipelines (recurring slots, queued content, autopost)
- Agents
- Analytics
- Followers
- Team management
- Media library
- Context documents

## Repository

This project is a monorepo with a root only package.json of dependencies.
Made with PNPM.
We have 3 important folders

- apps/backend - this is where the API code is (NESTJS)
- apps/orchestrator - this is temporal, it's for background jobs (NESTJS) it contains all the workflows and activities
- apps/frontend - this is the code of the frontend (Vite ReactJS)
- /libraries contains a lot of services shared between backend and orchestrator and frontend components.

We are using only pnpm, don't use any other dependency manager.
Never install frontend components from npmjs, focus on writing native components.

## Frontend

The project uses tailwind 3, before writing any component look at:

- /apps/frontend/src/app/colors.scss
- /apps/frontend/src/app/global.scss
- /apps/frontend/tailwind.config.js

All the --color-custom\* are deprecated, don't use them.

And check other components in the system before to get the right design.

For the frontend follow this:

- Many of the UI components lives in /apps/frontend/src/components/ui
- Routing is in /apps/frontend/src/app
- Components are in /apps/frontend/src/components
- always use SWR to fetch stuff, and use "useFetch" hook from /libraries/helpers/src/utils/custom.fetch.tsx

When using SWR, each one have to be in a separate hook and must comply with react-hooks/rules-of-hooks, never put eslint-disable-next-line on it.

It means that this is valid:

```ts
const useCommunity = () => {
  return useSWR....
}
```

This is not valid:

```ts
const useCommunity = () => {
  return {
    communities: () =>
      useSWR<CommunitiesListResponse>('communities', getCommunities),
    providers: () => useSWR<ProvidersListResponse>('providers', getProviders),
  };
};
```

## Backend

When working on the backend we need to pass the 3 layers:
DTO >> Controller >> Service >> Repository (no shortcuts)
In some cases we will have
DTO >> Controller >> Manager >> Service >> Repository.

Most of the server logic should be inside of libs/server.
The backend repository is mostly used to write controller, and import files from libs.server.

## Linting

Prefer scoped checks while iterating so concurrent agents do not hammer the
full monorepo suite. After editing files, run only:

```bash
pnpm exec prettier --write --cache <changed-files>
pnpm typecheck:changed
```

`pnpm typecheck:changed` typechecks the projects that own the dirty files, one
`tsc` at a time. Do not run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`,
or `pnpm check` after every edit.

Before finishing a task, run the orchestrated suite once from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm check
```

`pnpm check` already runs lint, format:check, typecheck, and test:changed.
Locally those steps are sequential; CI still parallelizes them. Do not run the
individual scripts and then also run `pnpm check`. Fix any reported issues
before finishing the task. Use `pnpm format` only when you need to auto-fix
Prettier across the repo.

## Conventions

- Use only pnpm.
- Never use RAW SQL queries, always use Prisma.
- Whenever you generate a PR, PR description, or similar, **always** follow the PR Template (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- Avoid as much as possible creating new files with pure logic of algorithms, it's usually wrong
- When you write code, make sure that what you add looks like something similar somewhere else in the code, don't make weird patterns
- Code must always be generic, there can't be a way that a specific logic, let's say facebook or instagram, appear in a file that use a generic logic, instead, we need to edit the interface of the provider, add another function, and then generically call it from the generic code, and then implement the specific logic in the provider implementation. we can't have something like if(facebookProvider) {} inside a non facebook provider file.
